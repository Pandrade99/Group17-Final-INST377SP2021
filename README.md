# Extinct Animals

### Description
Many people do not have knowledge about extinct animals, which is relevant to environmental science, history, biology, and possibly more fields, and so our web app will aim to not only educate and encourage people to learn about extinct animals, but also more specifically equip “extinct animals trackers” with the data and knowledge to protect animals similar to our focus group animals, which we have tentatively defined as North American animals under 10 pounds, from going extinct in the future. Armed with the information and visualizations that our web app provides, some of the trackers may even go tracking, and who knows, maybe even disprove the extinction of a species!
